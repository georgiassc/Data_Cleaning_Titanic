## About 

This repository contains the data cleaning process for the public Titanic accident dataset.
The main objective with this process is:
* to do a good cleaning of the data, taking into account null and unimportant values <br />
  
The process can be found in the file: Data_Cleaning_Titanic.ipynb

## Getting started
First, it's necessary run pandas in your device:
```
import pandas as pd
```
Then, you will need to import the titanic dataset. It's available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hesh97/titanicdataset-traincsv
```
titanic = pd.read_csv ('train.csv')
```

## Your opinion
I'm just curious in the world of data. If you have any suggestions on how to improve the process, feel free to do!
